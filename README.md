# Cell Classification Project

The purpose of this project was to investigate and explore how convolutation neural networks (CNN) work. Based on the paper: https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15842, this was an attempt to recreate the t-SNE plot for visualizing the cluster of similar/dissimilar cells. Included in this project is a Python file that organizes, splits, and trains the data.
